        λ
            value of lambda for the damping matrix Wn

        Returns
        -------
        sol
            inverse kinematic solution

        ``sol = ets.ik_lm_chan(Tep)`` are the joint coordinates (n) corresponding
        to the robot end-effector pose ``Tep`` which is an ``SE3`` or ``ndarray`` object.
        This method can be used for robots with any number of degrees of freedom.
        The return value ``sol`` is a tuple with elements:

        ============    ==========  ===============================================
        Element         Type        Description
        ============    ==========  ===============================================
        ``q``           ndarray(n)  joint coordinates in units of radians or metres
        ``success``     int         whether a solution was found
        ``iterations``  int         total number of iterations
        ``searches``    int         total number of searches
        ``residual``    float       final value of cost function
        ============    ==========  ===============================================

        If ``success == 0`` the ``q`` values will be valid numbers, but the
        solution will be in error.  The amount of error is indicated by
        the ``residual``.

        **Joint Limits**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, slimit=100)`` which is the deafualt for this method.
        The solver will initialise a solution attempt with a random valid q0 and
        perform a maximum of ilimit steps within this attempt. If a solution is not
        found, this process is repeated up to slimit times.

        **Global search**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, reject_jl=True)`` is the deafualt for this method.
        By setting reject_jl to True, the solver will discard any solution which
        violates the defined joint limits of the robot. The solver will then
        re-initialise with a new random q0 and repeat the process up to slimit times.
        Note that finding a solution with valid joint coordinates takes longer than
        without.

        **Underactuated robots:**

        For the case where the manipulator has fewer than 6 DOF the
        solution space has more dimensions than can be spanned by the
        manipulator joint coordinates.

        In this case we specify the ``we`` option where the ``we`` vector
        (6) specifies the Cartesian DOF (in the wrist coordinate frame) that
        will be ignored in reaching a solution.  The we vector has six
        elements that correspond to translation in X, Y and Z, and rotation
        about X, Y and Z respectively. The value can be 0 (for ignore)
        or above to assign a priority relative to other Cartesian DoF. The number
        of non-zero elements must equal the number of manipulator DOF.

        For example when using a 3 DOF manipulator tool orientation might
        be unimportant, in which case use the option ``we=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]``.

        ``sol = ets.ik_lm_chan(Tep)`` are the joint coordinates (n) corresponding

        For the case where the manipulator has fewer than 6 DOF the

        or above to assign a priority relative to other Cartesian DoF. The number
        of non-zero elements must equal the number of manipulator DOF.

        For example when using a 3 DOF manipulator tool orientation might

        ============    ==========  ===============================================

        If ``success == 0`` the ``q`` values will be valid numbers, but the
        solution will be in error.  The amount of error is indicated by
        the ``residual``.

        **Joint Limits**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, slimit=100)`` which is the deafualt for this method.
        The solver will initialise a solution attempt with a random valid q0 and
        perform a maximum of ilimit steps within this attempt. If a solution is not
        found, this process is repeated up to slimit times.

        **Global search**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, reject_jl=True)`` is the deafualt for this method.
        By setting reject_jl to True, the solver will discard any solution which
        violates the defined joint limits of the robot. The solver will then
        re-initialise with a new random q0 and repeat the process up to slimit times.
        Note that finding a solution with valid joint coordinates takes longer than
        without.

        **Underactuated robots:**

        For the case where the manipulator has fewer than 6 DOF the
        solution space has more dimensions than can be spanned by the
        manipulator joint coordinates.

        In this case we specify the ``we`` option where the ``we`` vector
        (6) specifies the Cartesian DOF (in the wrist coordinate frame) that
        will be ignored in reaching a solution.  The we vector has six
        elements that correspond to translation in X, Y and Z, and rotation
        about X, Y and Z respectively. The value can be 0 (for ignore)
        or above to assign a priority relative to other Cartesian DoF. The number
        of non-zero elements must equal the number of manipulator DOF.

        For example when using a 3 DOF manipulator tool orientation might
        be unimportant, in which case use the option ``we=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]``.

        Returns
        -------
        sol
            inverse kinematic solution

        ``sol = ets.ik_lm_chan(Tep)`` are the joint coordinates (n) corresponding
        to the robot end-effector pose ``Tep`` which is an ``SE3`` or ``ndarray`` object.
        This method can be used for robots with any number of degrees of freedom.
        The return value ``sol`` is a tuple with elements:

        ============    ==========  ===============================================
        Element         Type        Description
        ============    ==========  ===============================================
        ``q``           ndarray(n)  joint coordinates in units of radians or metres
        ``success``     int         whether a solution was found
        ``iterations``  int         total number of iterations
        ``searches``    int         total number of searches
        ``residual``    float       final value of cost function
        ============    ==========  ===============================================

        If ``success == 0`` the ``q`` values will be valid numbers, but the
        solution will be in error.  The amount of error is indicated by
        the ``residual``.

        **Joint Limits**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, slimit=100)`` which is the deafualt for this method.
        The solver will initialise a solution attempt with a random valid q0 and
        perform a maximum of ilimit steps within this attempt. If a solution is not
        found, this process is repeated up to slimit times.

        **Global search**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, reject_jl=True)`` is the deafualt for this method.
        By setting reject_jl to True, the solver will discard any solution which
        violates the defined joint limits of the robot. The solver will then
        re-initialise with a new random q0 and repeat the process up to slimit times.
        Note that finding a solution with valid joint coordinates takes longer than
        without.

        **Underactuated robots:**

        For the case where the manipulator has fewer than 6 DOF the
        solution space has more dimensions than can be spanned by the
        manipulator joint coordinates.

        In this case we specify the ``we`` option where the ``we`` vector
        (6) specifies the Cartesian DOF (in the wrist coordinate frame) that
        will be ignored in reaching a solution.  The we vector has six
        elements that correspond to translation in X, Y and Z, and rotation
        about X, Y and Z respectively. The value can be 0 (for ignore)
        or above to assign a priority relative to other Cartesian DoF. The number
        of non-zero elements must equal the number of manipulator DOF.

        For example when using a 3 DOF manipulator tool orientation might
        be unimportant, in which case use the option ``we=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]``.

        Synopsis
        --------
        The operation is defined by the choice of the ``method`` kwarg. 

        The step is deined as

        .. math::

            \vec{q}_{k+1} 
            &= 
            \vec{q}_k +
            \left(
                \mat{A}_k
            \right)^{-1}
            \bf{g}_k \\
            %
            \mat{A}_k
            &=
            {\mat{J}(\vec{q}_k)}^\top
            \mat{W}_e \
            {\mat{J}(\vec{q}_k)}
            +
            \mat{W}_n

        where :math:`\mat{W}_n = \text{diag}(\vec{w_n})(\vec{w_n} \in \mathbb{R}^n_{>0})` is a
        diagonal damping matrix. The damping matrix ensures that :math:`\mat{A}_k` is
        non-singular and positive definite. The performance of the LM method largely depends
        on the choice of :math:`\mat{W}_n`.

        *Chan's Method*

        Chan proposed

        .. math::

            \mat{W}_n
            =
            λ E_k \mat{1}_n

        where λ is a constant which reportedly does not have much influence on performance.
        Use the kwarg `k` to adjust the weighting term λ.

        *Sugihara's Method*

        Sugihara proposed

        .. math::

            \mat{W}_n
            =
            E_k \mat{1}_n + \text{diag}(\hat{\vec{w}}_n)

        where :math:`\hat{\vec{w}}_n \in \mathbb{R}^n`, :math:`\hat{w}_{n_i} = l^2 \sim 0.01 l^2`,
        and :math:`l` is the length of a typical link within the manipulator. We provide the
        variable `k` as a kwarg to adjust the value of :math:`w_n`.

        *Wampler's Method*

        Wampler proposed :math:`\vec{w_n}` to be a constant. This is set through the `k` kwarg.

        Examples
        --------
        The following example makes a ``panda`` robot object, makes a goal
        pose ``Tep``, and then solves for the joint coordinates which result in the pose
        ``Tep`` using the `ikine_LM` method.

        .. runblock:: pycon
        >>> import roboticstoolbox as rtb
        >>> panda = rtb.models.Panda()
        >>> Tep = panda.fkine([0, -0.3, 0, -2.2, 0, 2, 0.7854])
        >>> panda.ikine_LM(Tep)

        Notes
        -----
        The value for the ``k`` kwarg will depend on the ``method`` chosen and the arm you are
        using. Use the following as a rough guide ``chan, k = 1.0 - 0.01``,
        ``wampler, k = 0.01 - 0.0001``, and ``sugihara, k = 0.1 - 0.0001``

        When using the this method, the initial joint coordinates :math:`q_0`, should correspond
        to a non-singular manipulator pose, since it uses the manipulator Jacobian.

        This class supports null-space motion to assist with maximising manipulability and
        avoiding joint limits. These are enabled by setting kq and km to non-zero values.
